Build Lakewood, CO's canonical parcel parquet from live Jefferson County services.

Lakewood is a municipality inside Jefferson County, so the parcel source is
COUNTYWIDE (~259k parcels) and MUST be restricted to city limits. We clip on the
county's authoritative municipal-boundary layer (centroid-within), not on the
situs/mailing city string -- `PRPCTYNAM` is case-inconsistent and 3,063 parcels
carry a "LAKEWOOD" address while sitting in unincorporated Jeffco.

Jeffco schema notes (probed live 2026-08-20)
-------------------------------------------
- `TOTACTLNDV` / `TOTACTIMPV` / `TOTACTVAL` are Colorado *actual* (market)
  values. `ASMASD*` are assessed values (post-ratio) -- we want actual.
- `TAXCLS` is the Colorado 4-digit abstract class. Verified empirically:
    0xxx vacant land          1112/1115 single family      1120/1125 apartments
    1230/1212/1225/1250 condo 2xxx commercial             3xxx industrial
    4xxx agricultural         5xxx natural resources      9xxx EXEMPT
  The 9xxx = exempt inference was validated against owner names: City of
  Lakewood, Jefferson County School District R1, churches, CDOT/State Highway,
  metro districts, housing authority, Colorado Christian University, and the
  United States of America (the former Denver Federal Center, class 9119).
- `TOTACR` IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY. Class 9139 (school district) sums to 296,348
  acres inside a 28,000-acre city, and condo units report 0. All areas are
  therefore computed geodesically from geometry.
- `PIN` is 'ROW' for road right-of-way (6,033 polygons in Lakewood) and 'WATER'
  for water bodies. These are not assessable parcels and are dropped.

The condo trap (the Fort Collins lesson, present here) -- THREE regimes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Jefferson County maps THREE distinct parcel regimes, and they must be told apart
by whether the account owns ground *in fee*, not by `POLYCAT` (an earlier version
of this ETL keyed off `POLYCAT in (2,3)` and silently missed regime A entirely).

The reliable discriminator is `LGLSQFT`, the deeded legal area. For ordinary
fee-simple parcels `LGLSQFT / polygon_area` has a median of 1.001 (verified over
40,130 parcels), so `LGLSQFT <= 0` means "this account owns no ground in fee".

  regime N  fee-simple            ~40,130  LGLSQFT > 0.  Polygon IS the deeded
                                           lot. Nothing to do.
  regime A  attached / townhome    ~6,741  LGLSQFT = 0, `STTSTRC` = 'Townhomes',
                                           REAL per-unit land value (~$543M
                                           citywide). Polygon is the BUILDING
                                           FOOTPRINT only (median 794 sqft); the
                                           development's ground is a separate HOA
                                           tract. Because the height field is
                                           land_value_per_sqft, an unmerged
                                           townhome with $115k of land on a
                                           450 sqft footprint extrudes at
                                           $255/sqft against a true ~$18.
  regime C  true condominium       ~5,239  LGLSQFT = 0, class 1230/2245/3230,
                                           land value $0 (see limitation below).
                                           Unit polygons stacked on one
                                           footprint.

Both A and C are merged DOWN onto the development's ground tract. Linkage is by
PIN plat root (first three PIN groups, e.g. units `39-363-06-0xx` -> tract
`39-363-06-016`) and then by spatial adjacency, which is essential: several
developments' HOA tracts live in an ADJACENT plat root (root `49-173-03`'s units
sit on `49-172-06-191`, "SECOND GREEN MOUNTAIN TOWNHOUSE CORP", 18.3 acres).

*** The spatial test MUST be `intersects`, never `within`. *** The tract has each
unit footprint punched out as an interior ring, so a unit is never geometrically
`within` its own tract -- `within` matches ZERO units (measured). Holes are closed
with fill_holes() once the units are merged back in.

Guards that matter (each one is load-bearing; removing any re-breaks the map):
- A ground tract that has ANY unit on its plat root or adjacent to it is never
  dropped. The reverse -- dropping tracts that absorbed nothing -- is what
  deleted 533 acres of townhome ground in the 2026-08-20 build.
- `LGLSQFT <= 0` alone is NOT sufficient to call something a unit. 383 genuine
  fee-simple parcels merely lack a recorded `LGLSQFT` (e.g. `39-284-03-031`,
  Applewood Knolls, a real 1.28-acre lot; a 5.6-acre church). They are excluded
  by `TOTACR <= 0.10` -- a real lot states its acreage, a unit states ~0 -- plus
  a footprint cap for anything not stacked. They are additionally protected by
  the fact that nothing merges unless it links to a ground tract.
- Most ground tracts have a blank `TAXCLS`, but a handful are coded as vacant
  land (0xxx) with a nominal value and an association owner -- e.g. Sienna Park's
  `49-274-16-059`, 2.33 acres, $700, owner "SIENNA TOWNHOMES". Those count as
  tracts too, or 104 townhomes keep spiking.

Value aggregation, and why it differs from the account dedup below:
- Regime A/C unit values are GENUINE PER-UNIT ALLOCATIONS, so land and
  improvement values are SUMMED across a development's units.
- The `SCH` account dedup does the OPPOSITE (`first`), because there one
  account's single value is broadcast across its several GIS polygons and
  summing would inflate it N-fold.
  These two are easy to confuse. They are not the same operation.

*** KNOWN DATA LIMITATION (surfaced, not silently absorbed) ***
Regime C condo land value is genuinely absent from the Jeffco feed -- not hidden
in another field and not recoverable by any join. Of 5,800 class-1230 accounts in
the county pull, exactly ONE carries any land value. We therefore merge regime C
geometry but leave its land value at $0 rather than imputing one: CivicMapper
shows assessor data as published, and inventing land value in a public data
viewer is not acceptable. Those developments render flat/zero-height, which is
honest, and each carries a `land_value_basis` note explaining why so a viewer is
not left to conclude the land is worthless. ~5,200 condo parcels carrying ~$1.64B
of improvements are affected, so Lakewood's citywide land-value total
UNDERSTATES true land value. The ETL reports the magnitude so it can be cited.
