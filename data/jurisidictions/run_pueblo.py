Build Pueblo's canonical parcel parquet from live Pueblo County services.

Sources:
- Parcels (authoritative, ArcGIS Online):
  https://services1.arcgis.com/IL17xsvNU5Bmw3RY/ArcGIS/rest/services/County_Parcels/FeatureServer/0
- Municipal boundaries:
  https://maps.co.pueblo.co.us/outside/rest/services/Landbase/PuebloCounty_MunicipalCountyBoundaries/MapServer/0
- City zoning:
  https://maps.co.pueblo.co.us/outside/rest/services/Landbase/PuebloCounty_ZoningCountyCity/MapServer/0
- Per-parcel ground truth used while developing this ETL (no bulk endpoint):
  https://puebloco-search.gsacorp.io/parcel/<PAR_TXT>  (states "Acreage", the
  deeded area, which is what proved the sliver diagnosis below)

Why the parcel source moved (probed live 2026-08-26)
----------------------------------------------------
The old source, `maps.co.pueblo.co.us/.../PuebloCounty_Parcels/MapServer/1`,
renamed its columns: `Owner` -> `OwnerName`, `Neighborhood` -> `Neighborho`,
`LandActualValue` -> `LandActual`, `ImprovementsActualValue` -> `Improvem_1`,
and `AssessorURL` is gone. Requesting this ETL's own field list against it now
returns HTTP 400, so the ETL could not be re-run at all. The county's AGOL layer
`County_Parcels/FeatureServer/0` carries exactly the original field names plus
`LegalDescription`, `Zoning` and `NoDisplay`, so we point there instead. That
layer also states `TaxExempt` as 'yes'/'no' rather than 'Y'/'N' -- see below.

The condominium common-element trap (the defect Greg saw on the 3D map)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pueblo records commercial, office, medical and townhome condominiums as:
  - one GROUND tract per development, owned by the association, whose
    `LegalDescription` says "COMMON ELEMENT ...", "GCE ...", "CE ...", and which
    carries $0 (or a nominal) land value; and
  - one parcel per UNIT whose legal states an undivided interest in that ground
    ("+ INT IN CE", "+ 1/15TH OF COMMON GROUND", "1/26 INT IN + TO THE COMMON
    GROUND", "+ INTERST IN COMMON ELEMENT", ...).

The unit polygons are BUILDING FOOTPRINTS, not lots. Measured over the 57 in-city
tracts: the tracts hold 56.0 acres against only 17.9 acres of unit footprint. So
each unit's land_value_per_sqft -- the field the 3D map extrudes -- is divided by
roughly a quarter of the ground it actually occupies (Tuscany Villas' 95 units
read $12.31/sqft against a true $3.41), while the tract beside them carries $0 and
renders as a flat void. That is the "units floating above the ground" artifact.

We therefore merge each tract with its own units: union the geometry, sum the
values. Total land value and total acreage are untouched -- only the denominator
is repaired. Two developments (Champion Villa, Champion Villa North) additionally
have their units drawn ON TOP of the tract, so unioning also removes genuinely
double-counted acreage.

*** Do NOT try to identify this regime by assessor class code. *** An earlier
investigation tested only class 1130 (residential condominiums, which in Pueblo
genuinely do carry per-unit land value), concluded "Pueblo condos are clean", and
missed this entire commercial/mixed-use regime. `LegalDescription` is the only
field that states the regime, and the county's spelling of it is inconsistent
(COMMOM, ELEMENET, COMDOMINIUM, INTERST, INC for INT are all live in the feed).

Slivers, and what they actually turned out to be
------------------------------------------------
Checked against the assessor's stated acreage, the tiny-polygon-with-big-value
parcels are three different things, and only the first two are defects:
  1. FRAGMENT GEOMETRY -- the polygon is a scrap of a much larger deeded parcel.
     `0408101008` is 269 sqft of a 13.74-acre parcel ($153/sqft); `0524115017` is
     391 sqft of 195.6 acres; `1512224013` is 308 sqft of a 0.10-acre lot.
  2. UNATTRIBUTED POLYGONS -- no owner, no legal, $0/$0: a GIS polygon no account
     joined to. 18 of these sit in the city (14.0 acres, $0 land). One is
     `0419301007`, the 15.4-sqft polygon that carried $608,098 and a $39,362/sqft
     spike in the shipped build. They are dropped.
  3. GENUINELY TINY PARCELS -- real deeded scraps ("W 3.00 FT OF LOT 15",
     "A PARCEL 1 FT X 50 FT"). 75 of them, carrying $100-$5,400 each. Their
     $/sqft is honest but meaningless for a colour ramp.

Cases 1 and 3 are flagged `likely_remnant` rather than deleted, so their value
still counts in totals and only the per-parcel extruded layer skips them (set
`hideRemnants: true` in viz/src/cities/pueblo.json). The flag is NOT a bare size
threshold: it is size OR a neighborhood-relative $/sqft outlier, because Pueblo's
assessor values land at a near-uniform rate per neighborhood (both Eco Walk units
are exactly $7.35/sqft), which makes the ratio distribution tight enough -- p99.9
is 10.5x the neighborhood median -- for a 10x test to catch `0431447006` (528
sqft, above any size cutoff) without touching genuinely valuable parcels.

Duplicate PAR_TXT rows must be collapsed with `first`, never `sum`
-----------------------------------------------------------------
One account can be drawn as several polygons, and the county repeats the SAME
value on every row (verified: all 24 in-city duplicate groups have exactly one
distinct land value across their rows). Summing them fabricated $11,150,454 of
land value, $10.7M of it on a single parcel -- `1513303005` (Quik Trip) appears
7 times at $1,791,271 and was booked at $12,538,897.
